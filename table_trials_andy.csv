"NCT03288532","Renal Adjuvant MultiPle Arm Randomised Trial","https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03288532","RAMPART","RECRUITING","RATIONALE: The current global standard of care after nephrectomy for localised RCC therefore remains active monitoring (i.e., observation by clinical and radiological means). 30-40% patients with initially localised RCC develop metastatic disease following nephrectomy. Need for adjuvant therapy is most marked in the high risk population where outcomes are predictably poor. However, the risk of recurrence in patients who are of intermediate risk of recurrence is not insignificant. Unfortunately, despite showing efficacy in advanced RCC, the results in the adjuvant setting, so far, are inconclusive.

AIM: RAMPART is a phase III Multi-Arm Multi-Stage randomised controlled platform trial, initiated with three arms. The trial is assessing if durvalumab monotherapy or the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab can improve Disease Free Survival (DFS) or Overall Survival (OS) compared to the current global standard-of-care (active monitoring). At the start of recruitment, patients with Leibovich scores 3 to 11 will be eligible for randomisation. Accrual of intermediate risk patients (Leibovich scores 3 5) will stop after 3 years or when intermediate risk patients contribute 25% of the total accrual target, whichever is earlier. Recruitment of patients with Leibovich scores 6 to 11 will continue until the accrual target is reached.","Renal Cell Carcinoma","DRUG: Durvalumab|DRUG: Tremelimumab","University College, London","AstraZeneca|Kidney Cancer UK|Cancer Research UK","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",1750,"INTERVENTIONAL","07/19/18 00:00:00","07/01/24 00:00:00","07/01/24 00:00:00",0,402,1,0,,,402,402,402,0,1,402,402,"1",1,,18,,,,18

Primary Objectives

The primary objectives of this study are to determine:

* The impact on Depth of Response (DoR: less than VGPR versus VGPR or better) when salvage ASCT conditioning is augmented by the addition of a proteasome inhibitor
* The influence of a consolidation and maintenance strategy on the Durability of Response (DuR:PFS)

Secondary objectives

The secondary objectives of this study are to determine:

* Overall survival
* Time to disease progression
* The overall response rate following ixazomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (ITD) re-induction
* Time to next treatment
* Progression-free survival 2 (PFS2)
* Duration of response
* Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) negative rate post re-induction, post-ASCT and conversion after ITD consolidation
* Engraftment kinetics
* Toxicity and safety
* Quality of life (QoL)

Participant population (refer to protocol section 9 for a full list of eligibility criteria).

* Relapsed MM (with measurable disease by IMWG criteria) previously treated with ASCT
* First progressive disease (PD) at least 12 months since first ASCT, requiring therapy.
* ECOG Performance Status 0-2
* Aged at least 18 years
* Adequate full blood count and renal, hepatobiliary, pulmonary and cardiac function
* Written informed consent

Interventions: All participants will be registered at trial entry and will receive re-induction therapy with 4-6, 28-day cycles of ixazomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone (ITD), in order to reach maximum response. Participants who achieve at least stable disease (SD) will be randomised on a 1:1 basis to receive either conventional ASCT (ASCTCon), using melphalan, or augmented ASCT (ASCTAug), using melphalan with ixazomib. All participants achieving or maintaining a minimal response (MR) or better following trial ASCT will undergo a second randomisation to consolidation and maintenance or no further treatment. Participants randomised to consolidation and maintenance will receive treatment as follows: consolidation with 2 cycles of ITD and maintenance with ixazomib until disease progression.

Number of participants: 406 participants will be registered into the trial to allow 284 participants to be randomised at the first randomisation (R1) and 248 participants to be randomised at the second randomisation (R2).","Multiple Myeloma","DRUG: Ixazomib, thalidomide, & dexamethasone (ITD) re-induction|DRUG: Conventional autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT-con)|DRUG: Augmented autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT-aug)|DRUG: ITD consolidation and ixazomib maintenance vs. No further therap","University of Leeds","Cancer Research UK|Takeda","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",406,"INTERVENTIONAL","03/20/17 00:00:00","03/01/26 00:00:00","03/01/27 00:00:00",0,433,1,0,,,433,433,433,0,1,433,433,"2",0,,31,,,,31

FiTNEss (UK-MRA Myeloma XIV) - Frailty-adjusted therapy in Transplant Non-Eligible patients with newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma

Overview:

A phase III, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial to compare standard (reactive) and frailty-adjusted (adaptive) induction therapy delivery with the novel triplet ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRD), and to compare maintenance lenalidomide (R) to lenalidomide plus ixazomib (R+I) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma not suitable for a stem cell transplant.

All participants receive induction treatment with ixazomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone and are randomised on a 1:1 basis at trial entry to the use of frailty score-adjusted up-front dose reductions vs. standard up-front dosing followed by toxicity dependent reactive dose-modifications during therapy. Following 12 cycles of induction treatment participants alive and progression-free undergo a second randomisation on a 1:1 basis to maintenance treatment with lenalidomide plus placebo versus lenalidomide plus ixazomib. Participants and their treating physicians will be blinded to maintenance allocation.

Participant population:

* Newly diagnosed as having Multiple Myeloma (MM) according to the updated IMWG diagnostic criteria 2014 (see Appendix 1 for criteria)
* Not eligible for stem cell transplant
* Aged at least 18 years
* Able to provide written informed consent

Number of participants:

740 participants will be entered into the trial at Randomisation 1 (R1), with 478 participants at Randomisation 2 (R2).

Objectives:

The primary objectives of this study are to determine:

* Early treatment cessation (within 60 days of randomisation) for standard versus frailty-adjusted up-front dosing
* Progression-free survival (PFS, from maintenance randomisation) for lenalidomide + placebo (R) versus lenalidomide + ixazomib (R+I)

The secondary objectives of this study are to assess progression-free survival (PFS) for standard versus frailty-adjusted up-front dosing reductions, time to progression, time to 2nd PFS event (PFS2), overall survival (OS), survival after progression, deaths within 12 months of R1, overall response rate (ORR), attainment of â‰¥VGPR, attainment of MRD negativity, duration of response, time to improved response, time to next treatment, treatment compliance and total amount of therapy delivered, toxicity \& safety including the incidence of SPMs, Quality of Life (QoL), cost effectiveness of standard versus frailty-adjusted up-front dosing of IRD and cost-effectiveness of R + I versus R.

Exploratory objectives are prospective validation of a novel frailty risk score (UK-MRA Myeloma Risk Profile - MRP), usefulness of Karnofsky Performance Status (PS), and association of molecular subgroups with response, PFS and OS.","Multiple Myeloma","DRUG: R1: Ixazomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone (IRD) induction therapy - reactive arm|DRUG: R1: Ixazomib, Lenalidomide, Dexamethasone (IRD) induction therapy - adaptive arm|DRUG: R2: Lenalidomide plus placebo maintenance|DRUG: R2: Lenalidomide + ixazomib","University of Leeds","Cancer Research UK|Takeda|Celgene","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",740,"INTERVENTIONAL","08/04/20 00:00:00","12/01/24 00:00:00","12/01/24 00:00:00",0,444,0,0,"Newly diagnosed as having Multiple Myeloma (MM) according to the updated IMWG diagnostic criteria 2014 (see Appendix 1 for criteria)

It develops when white blood cells grow abnormally.

Typically a disease of the elderly, the median age of presentation is \>70 years and the current treatment for WM is unsatisfactory, with incomplete responses and inevitable recurrence. Therefore there is a need to find alternative treatments that are more effective, leading to lasting responses and improved quality of life.

The RAINBOW study is a phase 2-3 trial assessing 'chemotherapy free' treatment as primary therapy for WM which can potentially improve response outcome, durability and importantly, reduce toxicity for WM patients. This approach will be done using the drug Ibrutinib, which in combination with rituximab (RI) will be the experimental arm. As there is no agreed standard on first-line therapy for WM, the control arm is the current treatment based on the most recently published clinical trial results. The control arm consists of rituximab, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone (DCR), and is widely recommended by international consensus as appropriate treatment for first-line therapy for WM.

In this study, 148 adults (aged â‰¥ 18 years) with treatment naÃ¯ve WM will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio to either the treatment or control arm.

Randomised treatment lasts for a maximum of 6 cycles and response will be assessed following 3 cycles of treatment and completion of randomised treatment at approximately 24 weeks after commencing treatment. RI patients may then have up to 5 years of Ibrutinib monotherapy.

Patients will be seen regularly during treatment and then every 3 months for 5 years after treatment discontinuation. Patients will enter annual follow up for survival until the end of trial (including progressed patients).

The study will be conducted at NHS hospitals and is expected to last 9 years and 6 months.","Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia","DRUG: Dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, rituximab|DRUG: Rituximab, ibrutinib","University College, London","Janssen-Cilag Ltd.","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE2|PHASE3",148,"INTERVENTIONAL","02/03/20 00:00:00","03/01/30 00:00:00","03/01/30 00:00:00",0,487,1,0,,,487,487,487,0,1,487,487,"2",1,,69,,,,69

* Follow-up Phase includes:

  - 42 Day Safety Follow-up Visit
* During the Safety Follow up, the participants will be followed for 42 days after the last dose of luspatercept, for the assessment of safety-related parameters and adverse event (AE) reporting

  - Long-term Post-treatment Follow-up (LTPTFU) Phase
* Participants will be followed for overall survival every 6 months for at least 5 years from first dose of luspatercept in the parent protocol, or 3 years of post-treatment from last dose, whichever occurs later, or until death, withdrawal of consent, study termination, or until a subject is lost to follow-up.

MIBC is a type of cancer that has not spread from the muscles in the bladder to other parts of the body.

MIBC is treated by having surgery to remove the bladder (cystectomy). Not all people choose to have surgery and want to keep their bladder using other treatments.

Chemoradiotherapy (CRT)- is a type of non-surgical treatment for MIBC which combines Chemotherapy (a treatment with medicine to destroy cancer cells or stop them growing) and Radiation therapy (a treatment that uses beams of intense energy \[like X-rays\] to shrink or get rid of tumors).

Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer.

A placebo looks like the study medicine but has no study medicine in it. Using a placebo helps researchers better understand if the study medicine works.

The goal of this study is to learn: 1. If a study medicine pembrolizumab given with Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) can help people live longer without their cancer growing, spreading, or coming back compared to placebo given with CRT. 2.About the safety and how well people tolerate CRT alone or in combination with pembrolizumab.","Urinary Bladder Neoplasms","DRUG: Pembrolizumab|RADIATION: Conventional Radiotherapy (Bladder only)|RADIATION: Conventional Radiotherapy (Bladder and pelvic nodes)|RADIATION: Hypofractionated Radiotherapy (Bladder only)|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Fluorouracil (5-FU)|DRUG: Mitomycin C (MM","Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC",,"ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",636,"INTERVENTIONAL","05/19/20 00:00:00","06/10/29 00:00:00","06/10/31 00:00:00",0,81,1,0,,,81,81,81,0,1,81,81,"2",0,,90,,,,90

Epcoritamab is an investigational drug being developed for the treatment of DLBCL. Study doctors put the participants in groups called treatment arms. Participants will receive epcoritamab combined with R-CHOP, followed by epcoritamab or R-CHOP followed by rituximab will be explored. Approximately 900 adult participants with with newly diagnosed DLBCL will be enrolled in the study in approximately 315 sites in globally.

In the Arm 1, participants will receive subcutaneous epcoritamab combined with intravenous and oral R-CHOP followed by subcutaneous epcoritamab in 21-day cycles. In the Arm 2, participants will receive intravenous and oral R-CHOP followed by intravenous rituximab in 21-day cycles.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at an approved institution (hospital or clinic). The effect of the treatment will be frequently checked by medical assessments, blood tests, questionnaires and side effects.","Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma","DRUG: Epcoritamab|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|DRUG: Rituximab|DRUG: Vincristine|DRUG: Doxorubicin|DRUG: Prednisone","Genmab",,"ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",900,"INTERVENTIONAL","02/08/23 00:00:00","09/24/28 00:00:00","12/30/29 00:00:00",0,442,1,0,,,442,442,442,0,1,442,442,"2",1,,334,,,,123

Atezolizumab is designed to stop a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) being expressed on the cancer, allowing the immune system to recognise the tumour cells as foreign bodies and attack them. Atezolizumab has been shown to have activity in urothelial cancer which has spread.

There two cohorts for this trial. One cohort will investigate the most common histological type of urothelial cancer (transitional cell carcinoma) outside the bladder, for example in the upper urinary tract. The other cohort will investigate rarer histological subtypes (such as such as squamous cell or adenocarcinoma) of urothelial cancer throughout the entire urinary system.

This study will be recruiting patients from hospitals in the UK, France and Spain. If a patient is eligible for the study and decides to take part, they will receive up to two 3-weekly cycles of atezolizumab. 4-8 weeks after being enrolled, the patient will have an operation to remove the bladder (cystectomy) or the kidney, ureter and part of the bladder (nephroureterectomy or distal ureteral resection) as per normal practice. Following surgery, they will attend three hospital visits (4,12 and 24 weeks after surgery) and their disease progress/survival will be followed over the next 2 years. The clinical team will compare the patient's tumour tissue samples,scan results and blood results from before and after treatment with atezolizumab in order to see how well the drug works and if it is safe.

The aim of the first part of the trial is to identify the most appropriate dose of epcoritamab, and the aim of the second part of the trial is to assess the selected epcoritamab dose in a larger group of participants with B-NHL. All participants in this trial will receive either epcoritamab alone, or epcoritamab combined with another standard treatment regimen, with a total of 10 different treatment arms being studied.

Trial details include:

* The total trial duration will be up to 6 years.
* The treatment duration for each participant depends upon which arm of treatment they are assigned to receive, but will be no more than 3 years.
* The visit frequency for each participant depends upon which arm of treatment they are assigned to receive, but will be weekly to start for all participants, then will decrease to either: every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks, or every 4 weeks, or every 8 weeks.
* All participants will receive active drug; no one will be given placebo.

Participants who receive treatment with epcoritamab will have it injected right under the skin. Participants will receive a different regimen of epcoritamab depending upon which arm of treatment they are assigned.

Participants who receive standard treatments will have IV infusions and/or oral administration of those treatments. Participants will receive a different standard treatment regimen depending upon which arm of treatment they are assigned.

Currently there are no drugs proven to prevent COVID-19 or to reduce the severity of illness if given as prophylaxis. Although vaccines are now available, there remains a need for other prophylactic agents until vaccine use becomes widespread globally and effectiveness and durability is established, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, for whom vaccine responses may be suboptimal. Efforts are underway to repurpose established drugs with well understood drug interactions and safety profiles.

PROTECT-V is a platform trial to test prophylactic interventions against SARS-CoV2 infection in vulnerable patient populations at particularly high risk of COVID-19 and its complications, seeking to identify treatments that either might prevent the disease from occurring or may reduce the number of cases where the disease becomes serious or life-threatening.

In PROTECT-V, multiple agents can be evaluated on the same platform across vulnerable populations, with the option of adding additional treatments at later time points as these become available. The expectation is for as many sites as possible to recruit to all available trial treatments at any time, however, the platform structure and randomisation/data collection systems allow sites to open the trial treatment arms according to their capacity.

The trial opened with intranasal niclosamide and matched placebo, aiming to recruit 1500 vulnerable renal patients in February 2021. A parallel study protocol, was conducted in India, sponsored by The George Institute. Recruitment of around 750 Indian patients was completed in with the rest of the study arm recruitment in November 2022. The Niclosamide arm of the study was completed in June 2023.

The second agent, intranasal and inhaled ciclesonide and matched placebo, was meant to be added to the platform in mid-2022 in the same renal patient population however it was unable to be included due to other factor.

Sotrovimab and matched placebo have been added to the platform in August 2022 which aim to recruit approximately 800-1000 patients from the main study population with additional patient groups with primary immunodeficiency, any Haematology or Oncology patient who is currently receiving or has received chemotherapy or who is immunocompromised as a result of their disease or treatment, those with a diagnosis of an autoimmune or inflammatory disease receiving immunosuppression and also haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.","Covid19","DRUG: Niclosamide|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Ciclesonide|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Sotrovimab|DRUG: Placebo","Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust","Life Arc|Kidney Research UK (KRUK)|UNION therapeutics|Addenbrookes Charitable Trust|GlaxoSmithKline|National Institute for Health Research, United Kingdom","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE2|PHASE3",5000,"INTERVENTIONAL","02/19/21 00:00:00","07/01/24 00:00:00","12/01/24 00:00:00",0,463,0,0,,,463,463,463,0,0,463,463,,0,,179,,,,170

The primary treatment for early stage CRC is surgery to remove the tumour, which is possible in 80% of patients. Even after surgery up to half of patients will develop recurrence or spread of the disease (metastases) which is incurable. Survival after 5 years is approximately 14% for patients with metastatic disease. Clinical trials using immunotherapy drugs called 'immune checkpoint inhibitors' have shown excellent results in advanced colorectal cancer patients who have certain genetic characteristics called 'mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-d)' and 'high microsatellite instability (MSI-h)'. The benefits of immunotherapy as a treatment prior to surgery to remove the tumour (neoadjuvant treatment) has been observed in both melanoma and in glioblastoma with enhanced local and systemic anti-tumour responses.

Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy drug and works by helping the body's own immune system to fight the cancer cells. The NEOPRISM-CRC trial will investigate whether giving pembrolizumab before surgery is safe, and whether it improves the chances of the tumour being removed completely, and whether this delays or prevents the cancer from coming back.

Pembrolizumab treatment lasts for a maximum of 9 weeks (maximum of 3 cycles of treatment, each cycle consisting of 3 weeks) and is given prior to surgery. Following surgery patients will be followed up for at least 3 years after their surgery and to a maximum of 5 years. Target recruitment is 32 patients and recruitment is expected to take place over a 24 month period.

Blood, tissue, mouth swabs and stool samples will be collected from patients throughout the trial to better understand the biology of immunotherapy as a treatment for CRC prior to surgery.","Adenocarcinoma of the Colon","DRUG: Pembrolizumab","University College, London","Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC|Sharp Clinical Services|Foundation Medicine|University College London (UCL) Cancer Institute|University of Leeds|University College London Hospitals","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE2",32,"INTERVENTIONAL","07/20/22 00:00:00","09/01/24 00:00:00","09/01/27 00:00:00",0,133,0,0,,,133,133,133,0,1,133,133,,0,,261,,,,248

* What side effects may happen from receiving the study drugs
* How much study drug is in the blood at different times
* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drugs (which could make the drugs less effective or could lead to side effects). Antibodies are proteins that are naturally found in the blood stream that fight infections.

Advanced solid tumors are solid cancers that may have spread to nearby tissue, lymph nodes and/or to distant parts of the body and that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with currently available treatments.

A new therapy available for advanced solid cancers is immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. This drug class stimulates immune cells to kill cancer cells by blocking a protein called PD-1. Although PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have shown benefits in treatment of cancer, only a subset of patients benefit from the initial therapy, while in others the cancer comes back. One reason could be that the ability of the patients' immune systems to kill cancer cells is weakened by so-called regulatory T cells which have a suppressive effect on the immune system.

The study treatment BAY3375968 is an antibody that binds to a protein called CCR8 which is located on the surface of regulatory T cells. This leads to a reduction in regulatory T cells and further inhibits their immune suppressive activity, so that the immune response against cancer can be strengthened as observed in animal models. Animal studies also showed that BAY3375968 may add more anti-cancer effect to immunotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors when used in combination. All of these previous observations need to be confirmed in humans.

The main aims of this study are to find for BAY3375968 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor):

* how safe it is
* the degree to which overt medical problems caused by the treatment(s) can be tolerated
* the highest amount of BAY3375968 that can be given alone or in combination with pembrolizumab.
* how it moves into, through, and out of the body.

To do this, researchers will collect and analyze data about:

* the number and severity of participants' medical problems after taking their treatments
* the best dose of BAY3375968 that can be given
* the highest level in the blood (Cmax) and the total level (AUC) of BAY3375968.

Doctors keep track of all medical problems (also called adverse events) that participants have during the study, even if they do not think that they might be related to the study treatment.

The researchers will also study the activity of BAY3375968 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab against the cancer.

The study will have 2 parts. Part 1 (dose escalation) focuses on tumor types that respond to immunotherapy. It will help to find the best dose for BAY3375968 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab that can be given in part 2. For this, the participants will receive one specific dose of several increasing BAY3375968 doses tested in part 1. Dose escalation of BAY3375968 alone will be done prior to the dose escalation of the combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab.

The participants of part 2 (dose expansion), will receive the best dose of BAY3375968 alone or in combination with pembrolizumab found in part 1. This part of the study focuses on certain cancer types of the lung, breast, head and neck cancer, and melanoma.

The total duration of the study will be approximately 4 years and 7 months. Each participant in the study will visit the study site twice before starting their treatment. Once the treatment starts, the frequency of visits is 5 times per week in the first treatment week and 1 to 3 times per month in later treatment periods. Another visit will be scheduled for the participants within 30 days after the last treatment in the study.

During the study, the study team will:

* take blood and urine samples
* do physical and vital signs examinations
* examine heart health using ECG and Echocardiogram
* check the tumor status and if the participants' cancer has grown and/or spread using imaging techniques
* take tumor samples
* ask questions about the impact of the disease on the participants' general well-being and activities of daily life.

About 90 days after the participants receive their last treatment and discontinued the study, the doctors will check the participants' health. In case a new anticancer therapy has been started, medical problems will be recorded via a phone call.

The study team will continue to check the participants' cancer status about every 12 weeks until their cancer gets worse, the start of a new anti-cancer therapy, or withdrawal of consent. In addition, every 6 months for up to 24 months after the last participant left the study the study team will check the participants' survival and subsequent anticancer treatment by phone until the end of this study.","Advanced Solid Tumors","DRUG: BAY3375968|DRUG: Pembrolizumab","Bayer",,"ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE1",270,"INTERVENTIONAL","10/11/22 00:00:00","10/18/26 00:00:00","05/04/27 00:00:00",0,45,1,0,,,45,45,45,0,1,45,45,"1",0,,323,,,,322

Advanced solid tumors are types of cancer that may have spread to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, and/or to distant parts of the body and that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with currently available treatments. This study focuses on certain types of skin cancer, kidney cancer, stomach cancer, and lung cancer.

The study treatment BAY2965501 is currently under development as monotherapy or in combination with a drug named pembrolizumab for the treatment of people with advanced solid tumors.

BAY2965501 blocks an enzyme in T-cells to activate them. T-cells are a type of immune cell that are known to have an anti-cancer effect and BAY2965501 is a potential new immunotherapy.

The main purpose of this first-in-human study is to learn:

* how safe different doses of BAY2965501 are when given as a single drug or in combination,
* the degree to which medical problems caused by BAY2965501 when given as a single drug or in combination, can be tolerated (also called tolerability),
* what maximum amount can be given as a single drug or in combination, and
* how it moves into, through and out of the body as a single drug or in combination.

To answer this, researchers will look at:

* the number and severity of medical problems participants have after taking BAY2965501 as a single drug or in combination for each dose level. These medical problems are also referred to as adverse events.
* the (average) total level of BAY2965501 in the blood (also called AUC) after intake of single and multiple doses
* the (average) highest level of BAY2965501 in the blood (also called Cmax) after intake of single and multiple doses Doctors keep track of all medical problems that participants have during the study, even if they do not think the medical problem might be related to the study treatment.

In addition, the researchers want to know if and how the participants' tumors change after taking BAY2965501.

The study will have two parts. The first part, called dose escalation, is done to find the most appropriate dose that can be given in the second part. For this, participants will be assigned to receive one of the planned doses and schedules of BAY2965501 as single drug or participants will be assigned to one of the increasing doses of BAY2965501 in combination with 200mg pembrolizumab. All participants will take BAY2965501 by mouth. Additionally, in the combination group, pembrozilumab will be given.

In the second part, called dose expansion, all participants in the single drug group will receive up to 2 of the most appropriate doses of BAY2965501 from the 1st part as tablet by mouth. The participants in the combination group will receive the most appropriate dose of BAY2965501 from the first part.

Participants in both parts of the study, will take the study treatment until the tumor gets worse (also known as 'disease progression'), or until the participants have medical problems. In general, the study treatment is planned for a maximum of 35 cycles.

Each participant will be in the study for several months, including a screening phase of up to 28 days, few months of treatment depending on the participant's benefit, and a follow up phase after the end of treatment. The following approximate numbers of visits to the study site are planned: two during the screening phase, six in the first treatment month, one to three per month in the following periods.

Participants in part two will be assigned to one of 3 groups depending on cancer characteristics.

Study procedures described below may vary between these groups.

During the study, the study team will:

* take blood and urine samples
* do physical examinations
* check vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature
* examine heart health using ECG (electrocardiogram)
* check if the participants' cancer has grown and/or spread using CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and, if needed, bone scan
* take tumor samples (if required)

The treatment period ends with a visit no later than 7 days after the last BAY2965501 dose in the single drug and combination group. About 30 and 90 days after the last dose and every 12 weeks thereafter, the study team will check the participants' health and any changes in cancer. This follow-up period ends with worsening of the cancer, start of new anti-cancer therapy, or until the participant leaves the study. In addition, the study doctors and their team will contact the participant every 12 weeks to learn about the participant's survival. This ends no later than 12 months after the last participant started treatment or by the end of the study, whichever comes first.","Advanced Solid Tumors","DRUG: BAY2965501|DRUG: Pembrolizumab","Bayer",,"ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE1",284,"INTERVENTIONAL","11/04/22 00:00:00","08/10/26 00:00:00","08/10/26 00:00:00",0,37,1,0,,,37,37,37,0,1,37,37,"1",0,,344,,,,339

Linvoseltamab has previously been studied by itself (without other cancer drugs) in participants who had advanced multiple myeloma that returned and needed to be treated again after many other therapies had failed. These participants were no longer benefiting from standard medications and had no good treatment options. In that study, some participants who were treated with linvoseltamab had improvement of their myeloma (shrinkage of their tumors), including some participants who had complete responses (that is, the treatment got rid of all evidence of myeloma in their bodies).

This study is focused on participants who have multiple myeloma that has returned or needs to be treated again after one to four prior treatments and have standard cancer treatment options available to them. The aim of this study is to see how safe and effective linvoseltamab is compared to a combination of three cancer drugs: elotuzumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone, (called EPd) in participants who have returned after having received prior treatment that included lenalidomide, a proteosome inhibitor, and (for participants in some countries) a cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) antibody. Half of the participants in this study will get linvoseltamab, and the other half will get EPd.

This study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* How long participants benefit from receiving linvoseltamab compared with EPd
* How many participants treated with linvoseltamab or EPd have improvement of their multiple myeloma and by how much
* What side effects happen from taking linvoseltamab compared to EPd
* How long participants live while receiving treatment or after treatment with linvoseltamab compared to EPd

Pembrolizumab, also known as Keytruda, is licenced and available by prescription to treat a variety of cancers. Tepotinib is currently licensed in the UK for use in non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC) and is being investigated for this purpose.

Cancer immunotherapy drugs hold great promise but still do not work for many patients. Laboratory studies on cancers that do not respond well to immunotherapy reveal that most of these tumours do not have any immune cells. This suggests that the cancer has successfully hidden itself and avoided being recognised by the immune system. This study aims to use a novel approach using a targeted drug, tepotinib, to target the gene involved with NSCLC.

Tepotinib is a type of drug called a kinase inhibitor. Kinase inhibitors are a newer type of drug being used to try to treat cancers. They act by blocking some of the chemical messengers that are part of the signalling process within cancer cells that control their growth. Tepotinib is used in adults to treat NSCLC that can have certain abnormal changes in the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor gene (MET) and which has spread and/or cannot be removed by surgery. The changes in the MET gene can make an abnormal protein which can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. By blocking this abnormal protein, tepotinib may slow or stop the cancer from growing as well as potentially shrinking the cancer. This study will include patients with and without the MET exon 14 mutations.

In this clinical study, the investigators aim to test our ideas in a small number of people for the first time, specifically in those patients with cancers which do not respond to cancer immunotherapy.","Advanced Cancer|Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","DRUG: Tepotinib|DRUG: Pembrolizumab","Institute of Cancer Research, United Kingdom","Merck Serono GmbH, Germany|Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE1",38,"INTERVENTIONAL","05/03/23 00:00:00",,,0,225,0,0,,,225,225,225,0,1,225,225,,0,,390,,,,385

"NCT05794906","A Study to Compare Darolutamide Given With Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) With ADT in Men With Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Raise of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Levels After Local Therapies","https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05794906","ARASTEP","RECRUITING","Researchers are looking for a better way to treat men at high-risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer.

BCR means that in men who had prostate cancer and were treated by either surgery and/ or radiation therapy, the blood level of a specific protein called PSA rises. PSA is a marker of prostate cancer cells activity. The PSA increase means that the cancer has come back even though conventional imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scans does not show any lesion of prostate cancer. Recently a more sensitive imaging method called prostate-specific membrane antigen \[PSMA\] positron emission tomography \[PET\]) /computed tomography \[CT\]) scan may identify prostate cancer lesions not detectable by conventional imaging. Men with BCR have a higher risk of their cancer spreading to other parts of the body, particularly when PSA levels raised to a certain limit within a short period of time after local therapies. Once the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it can become even harder to treat.

In men with prostate cancer, male sex hormones (also called androgens) like testosterone can help the cancer grow and spread. To reduce androgens levels in these patients, there are treatments that block androgens production in the body called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT is often used to stop prostate cancer. Another way to stop prostate cancer growth and spread is to block the action of androgen receptors on prostate cancer cells called androgen receptor inhibitors (ARIs). The new generation ARIs including darolutamide can block the action of androgens receptors and are available for the treatment of prostate cancer in addition to ADT. It is already known that men with prostate cancer benefit from these treatments.

The main objective of this study is to learn if the combination of darolutamide and ADT prolongs the time that the participants live without their cancer getting worse, or to death due to any cause, compared to placebo (which is a treatment that looks like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it) and ADT given for a pre-specified duration of 24 months.

To do this, the study team will measure the time from the date of treatment allocation to the finding of new cancer spread in the participants by using PSMA PET/CT, or death due to any cause. The PSMA PET/CT scans is performed using a radioactive substance called a ""tracer"" that specifically binds to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) which is a protein often found in large amounts on prostate cancer cells.

To avoid bias in treatment, the study participants will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two treatment groups. Based on the allocated treatment group, the participants will either take darolutamide plus ADT or placebo plus ADT twice daily as tablets by mouth. The study will consist of a test (screening) phase, a treatment phase and a follow-up phase. The treatment duration is pre-specified to be 24 months unless the cancer gets worse, the participants have medical problems, or they leave the study for any reason. In addition, image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) or surgery is allowed and your doctor will explain the benefits and risks of this type of therapy.

During the study, the study team will:

* take blood and urine samples.
* measure PSA and testosterone levels in the blood samples
* do physical examinations
* check the participants' overall health
* examine heart health using electrocardiogram (ECG)
* check vital signs
* check cancer status using PSMA PET/CT scans, CT, MRI and bone scans
* take tumor samples (if required)
* ask the participants if they have medical problems

About 30 days after the participants have taken their last treatment, the study doctors and their team will check the participants' health and if their cancer worsened. The study team will continue to check this and regularly ask the participants questions about medical problems and subsequent therapies until they leave the study for any reason or until they leave the study for any reason or until the end of the study, whatever comes first.","Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer","DRUG: Darolutamide (BAY1841788, Nubeqa)|OTHER: Placebo matching darolutamide|OTHER: ADT","Bayer",,"MALE","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",750,"INTERVENTIONAL","04/03/23 00:00:00",,,0,244,0,0,,,244,244,244,0,1,244,244,,0,,394,,,,389

"NCT05850520","A Study to Learn How Well a Higher Amount of Aflibercept Given as an Injection Into the Eye Works and How Safe it is in People With Reduced Vision Due to Swelling in the Macula, Central Part of the Retina Caused by a Blocked Vein in the Retina (Macula Ede","https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05850520","QUASAR","RECRUITING","Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO).

In people with RVO, a blood vessel that carries blood away from the retina (vein) becomes blocked. The retina is the very back part of the eye. The blocked vein causes fluid and blood to leak into the retina and thereby causes a swelling of the macula (the center of the retina responsible for fine vision). This swelling is called macular edema.

When a vein in the retina is blocked, the levels of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) rises. VEGF helps the growth of new blood vessels. This can lead to macular edema and may cause the vision to become blurry.

The study treatment intravitreal (IVT) aflibercept is given as an injection into the eye. It works by blocking VEGF and this can help repair vision problems related to RVO. IVT aflibercept is already available and is prescribed by doctors as the standard of care treatment for macula edema secondary to RVO. Standard of care is a treatment that medical experts consider most appropriate for a disease.

Standard of care is given every 4 weeks in people with macula edema secondary to RVO. While repeated injections of aflibercept may prevent worsening of vision, it may place a burden on the patient. However, a higher amount (8 mg) compared to the standard of care (2 mg) of IVT aflibercept is being tested in studies. This higher amount could be given less often. The amount of IVT aflibercept given is measured in milligrams, also known as mg.

The main purpose of this study is to learn how well a higher amount of the study treatment aflibercept works in people with macular edema secondary to RVO. To answer this, researchers will measure changes in vision called best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study participants between study start and after 36 weeks of treatment. Changes will then be compared between those participants who received the higher amount of IVT aflibercept and those that received standard of care.

To learn how safe the study treatment is in the participants, the researchers will count the number of participants from study start and up to 64 weeks later that have:

* adverse events
* serious adverse events

""Adverse events"" are any medical problems that the participants have during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think they might be related to the study treatments. An adverse event is considered ""serious"" when it leads to death, puts the participants' lives at risk, requires hospitalization, causes disability, causes a baby being born with medical problems or is otherwise medically important.

Dependent on the treatment group, the participants will either receive the higher amount of aflibercept or standard of care as an intravitreal injection for up to 60 weeks. The study will consist of a test (screening) phase, a treatment phase and an end of study phase. Each participant will be in the study for up to 64 weeks.

One visit to the study site is planned during the screening phase, followed by visits approximately every 4 weeks (16 in total) during treatment and one visit at the end of the study.

During the study, the study doctors and their team will:

* check patients' eye health using various eye examination techniques
* measure patients' eye vision (BCVA)
* take blood and urine samples
* do physical examinations
* check vital signs
* examine heart health using electrocardiogram (ECG)
* do pregnancy tests in women of childbearing age

In addition, participants will be asked to fill a questionnaire on vision-related quality of life.","Macular Edema Secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion","DRUG: Aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye(Eylea, BAY86-5321)_higher dose|DRUG: Aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye(Eylea, BAY86-5321)_2 mg|DRUG: Sham|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Fluorescein","Bayer","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",822,"INTERVENTIONAL","05/15/23 00:00:00",,,0,342,0,0,,,342,342,342,0,1,342,342,,0,,405,,,,400

Another purpose is to check whether BI 764532 can make tumours shrink. BI 764532 is an antibody-like molecule (DLL3/CD3 bispecific) that may help the immune system fight cancer.

Participants are put into 2 groups randomly, which means by chance. One group gets dose 1 of BI 764532 and the other group gets dose 2 of BI 764532. Participants get BI 764532 infusions into a vein when starting treatment. If there is benefit for the participants and if they can tolerate it, the treatment is given up to the maximum duration of the study. During this time, participants visit the study site regularly. The total number of visits depends on how they respond to and tolerate the treatment. The first study visits include an over-night stay to monitor participants' safety.

The study is seeking participants who:

* have advanced or metastatic melanoma (has spread to other parts of the body);
* have a certain abnormal gene called ""BRAF"".
* have taken nivolumab or pembrolizumab treatment before this study.

Participants will either receive:

* pembrolizumab given by intravenous infusion (directly into a vein) every 3 weeks at the study clinic. Participants will also receive encorafenib and binimetinib by mouth every day at home,
* or will receive ipilimumab and nivolumab given by intravenous infusion (directly into a vein) every 3 weeks at the study clinic 4 times. This will be followed by nivolumab given by intravenous infusion every 4 weeks at the study clinic.

Both pembrolizumab and nivolumab will be given for a maximum of around 2 years. However, there is no time limit for encorafenib and binimetinib treatment.

In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), the cancer of the prostate has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) and does not respond to the lowering of testosterone levels in the body (castration resistant). The cancer is 'advanced' and is unlikely to be cured or controlled with currently available treatments. Despite new treatment options for men with prostate cancer in recent years, the cancer often returns and worsens.

The study treatment actinium-225-macropa-pelgifatamab (also called 225Ac-pelgi or BAY3546828) is a new type of treatment under development for men with mCRPC who have already received available treatments or have few treatment options available. It works by binding to a protein on the surface of the cancer cells called prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). As it gives off a type of radioactivity that travels a very short distance, it kills the nearby (cancer) cells that express PSMA.

The main purpose of this first-in-human study in men with mCRPC is to learn:

* How safe different doses of 225Ac-pelgi are.
* To what degree medical problems caused by 225Ac-pelgi can be tolerated by the participants?
* Which dose of 225Ac-pelgi is optimal for treatment (safe and working well)?
* How good is 225Ac-pelgi's anticancer activity?

To answer this, the researchers will look at:

* The number and severity of medical problems that the participants have after treatment with 225Ac-pelgi (per dose level).
* The ratio of medical problems and anticancer activity per dose.
* Anticancer activity of the optimal 225Ac-pelgi dose as proportion of participants who have at least halved prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after 12 weeks of treatment or later and/or shrunken or no longer detectable tumors.
* The lowest PSA level reached after treatment start.

Doctors keep track of all medical problems (also called adverse events) that participants have during the study, even if they do not think that they might be related to the study treatment.

Anticancer activity is measured using cancer imaging techniques and change in blood level of a protein called PSA. PSA is made by normal and by cancerous cells in the body. The PSA level is taken as a marker for prostate cancer development and is usually elevated in men with mCRPC.

In addition, researchers want to find out how 225Ac-pelgi moves into, through and out of the body.

The study will have two parts. The first part, called dose escalation, is done to find the most appropriate dose and schedule that can be given in the second part of the study. For this, each participant will receive one of the predefined increasing doses of 225Ac-pelgi as an infusion into the vein. All participants in part 2, called dose expansion, will receive the most appropriate dose and schedule identified from the first part of the study. More than one dose level or schedule from part 1 may be tested. Both the participants and the study team know what treatment the participants will take.

Participants in this study will take the study treatment 225Ac-pelgi once in a period of 6 weeks called a cycle. Each participant will have 4 of these treatment cycles, if the participant benefits from the treatment.

Each participant will be in the study for up to nearly six years, including a first test (screening) phase of a maximum of 28 days, up to 12 months of treatment depending on the participant's benefit, and a follow-up phase of 60 months after the end of treatment. The following visits to the study site are planned: 2 during the screening phase, 8 in the first treatment cycle, 7 in subsequent cycles, and a visit 6 to 12 weeks after the last dose. In the following 12 months, visits are planned every 6 weeks and during the next 48 months phone calls or clinic visits are planned approximately every 12 weeks.

In addition, a sub study during the dose escalation part will gather information on the distribution of the study treatment in the body, the proportion that binds to the cancer cells, and the resulting radiation at the tumor site.

During the study, the study team will:

* Do physical examinations
* Check vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature
* Take blood, and urine samples
* Examine heart health using echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (ECG)
* Take tumor samples
* Track 225Ac-pelgi in the body using gamma imaging (generally available at all study sites)
* Check the tumor status using PET (positron emission tomography), CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and, if needed, bone scan

* are 18 years of age or older;
* are hormone receptor (HR)-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative;
* have advanced or metastatic breast cancer after taking other treatments before this study;
* have not taken or need to take medications that are not allowed by the study protocol;
* do not have any medical or mental conditions that may increase the risk of study participation.

Half of the participants will take PF-07220060 two times daily by mouth along with fulvestrant. Fulvestrant will be given as a shot into the muscle. The other half will take the study doctor's choice of treatment which can either be:

* Fulvestrant alone taken as shot into the muscle.
* Everolimus along with exemestane taken once daily by mouth.

This study will compare the experiences of participants receiving the study medicine plus fulvestrant to those who are receiving the study doctor's choice of treatment. This will help decide if the study medicine is safe and effective.

Participants will receive study treatment and/or will be in the study until:

* imaging scans (such as an MRI and/or CT) show that their cancer is getting worse.
* the study doctor thinks the participant is no longer benefitting from the study medicine.
* has side effects that become too severe. A side effect is a reaction (expected or unexpected) to a medicine or treatment you take.

Solid tumors are cancers that start in a part of your body like your lungs or liver instead of your blood. Once tumors have grown bigger in one place but haven't spread, they're called locally advanced. If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body, it's called metastatic. When a cancer has gotten so big it can't easily be removed or has spread to other parts of the body, it is called unresectable. These types of cancer are harder to treat.

Patients in this study must have cancer that has come back or did not get better with treatment. Patients must have a solid tumor cancer that can't be treated with standard of care drugs.

This clinical trial uses an experimental drug called SGN-CEACAM5C. SGN-CEACAM5C is a type of antibody-drug conjugate or ADC. ADCs are designed to stick to cancer cells and kill them. They may also stick to some normal cells.

This study will test the safety of SGN-CEACAM5C in participants with solid tumors that are hard to treat or have spread throughout the body.

This study will have 3 parts. Part A and Part B of the study will find out how much SGN-CEACAM5C should be given to participants. Part C will use the information from Parts A and B to see if SGN-CEACAM5C is safe and if it works to treat solid tumor cancers.","Colorectal Neoplasms|Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung|Stomach Neoplasms|Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma|Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma|Small Cell Lung Carcinoma","DRUG: SGN-CEACAM5C","Seagen Inc.","Sanofi","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE1",410,"INTERVENTIONAL","11/20/23 00:00:00","03/31/29 00:00:00","03/31/30 00:00:00",0,159,1,0,,,159,159,159,0,1,159,159,"not stated",0,,462,,,,462

The study is focused on patients who have one of two types of cancer: follicular lymphoma (FL) or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) that has come back after treatment (called ""relapsed""), or did not respond to treatment (called ""refractory""). FL and MZL are subtypes of Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma (NHL).

This study will be made up of two parts (Part 1 not randomized, Part 2 randomized - controlled). The aim of Part 1 of the study is to see how safe and tolerable the study drug is when used in combination with lenalidomide, in participants with FL or MZL, and to determine the dose of the study drug to be used in Part 2 of this study. This combination is considered ""first-in-human"" as it has not been tested as a combination treatment in humans before. The aim of Part 2, of the study is to assess how the combination of odronextamab and lenalidomide works compared to the combination of rituximab and lenalidomide, (the current standard-of-care treatment for FL and/or MZL). Standard-of-care means the usual medication expected and used when receiving treatment for a condition.

The study is looking at several other research questions, including:

* What side effects may happen from taking the study drug in combination with lenalidomide
* How much study drug is in your blood at different times
* Whether the body makes antibodies against the study drug (which could make the study drug less effective or could lead to side effects)

Patients will receive either BNT314 alone or BNT314 combined with pembrolizumab.

Phase 1 of the study consists of a dose escalation part, and a safety run-in (SRI) and expansion part:

Dose escalation: In this part of the study, patients will be assigned to multiple dose levels (DLs) of BNT314 given alone. By escalating the dose with a small group of patients, the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) which is the highest dose with acceptable safety and manageable side effects, or the maximum administered dose (MAD) will be investigated. At the end of this part, the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) which is the dose to be tested in Phase 2 will be decided.

Safety Run-In: In this part of the study, BNT314 will be combined with pembrolizumab. Before starting the expansion part, the combination will be tested in another small group of participants (12-28) to find out how safe this combination is.

Expansion: In this part of the study, BNT314 will be combined with pembrolizumab. After the SRI is completed, the study will continue with the expansion part where up to 199 participants with different types of cancer will be included.

The Phase 2 part of the study will be introduced via an amendment to the study protocol.","Advanced Malignant Solid Tumor","BIOLOGICAL: BNT314|BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab","BioNTech SE","Genmab","ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE1|PHASE2",360,"INTERVENTIONAL","11/30/23 00:00:00","02/01/30 00:00:00","02/01/30 00:00:00",0,83,1,0,,,83,83,83,0,1,83,83,"1",0,,471,,,,471

People can join the study if they have tumours with HER2 mutations and have not yet received any systemic therapy including chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called zongertinib (BI 1810631) can slow down the worsening of advanced non-small cell lung cancer better than the standard treatment available. Zongertinib may slow cancer cell growth by inhibiting HER2. This would prolong cancer re-occurrence and increase survival. Current standard treatment is pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy.

Participants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group receives zongertinib at regular times throughout the study and the other group receives infusions of pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin (pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy) into a vein.

Participants may be in the study up to a maximum of 70 months. During this time, they visit the study site about every 3 weeks for study procedures. The doctors regularly check the size of the tumour with a CT or MRI scan, at the beginning of the study and every 6 weeks. After 18 months they check the tumour size every 12 weeks. Doctors regularly check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects. The time it takes for the cancer to worsen is compared between the 2 groups to see whether the treatment works. The participants also fill in questionnaires about their symptoms and quality of life.","Lung Cancer, Non-squamous, Non-small Cell","DRUG: zongertinib|DRUG: pembrolizumab|DRUG: cisplatin|DRUG: carboplatin|DRUG: pemetrexed","Boehringer Ingelheim",,"ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE3",270,"INTERVENTIONAL","01/15/24 00:00:00",,,0,314,0,0,,,314,314,314,0,1,314,314,,0,,472,,,,472

mCRPC is a cancer of the prostate (male reproductive gland found below the bladder) that has spread to other parts of the body. This type of prostate cancer does not respond to hormone treatment used to lower the level of testosterone, a male sex hormone, to prevent cancer from growing.

The study treatment 225Ac-PSMA-Trillium, also called BAY3563254, is under development to treat advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. It works by binding to PSMA and giving off radiation that can damage cancer cells and stop them from growing.

The main purpose of this first-in-human study is to learn:

* How safe is BAY3563254 in participants.
* What is the recommended dose of BAY3563254 that is safe and works well that will be further tested in Part 2 of the study.
* How well does BAY3563254 work in participants.

To answer this, the researchers will look at:

* The number and severity of medical problems including serious medical problems that participants experience after taking BAY3563254
* The number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) at each dose level. A DLT is a medical problem caused by a drug that is too severe to continue the use of that specific dose.
* The number of participants whose cancer completely disappears (complete response) or reduces by at least 30% (partial response) after taking the treatment (also known as objective response rate (ORR))
* The number of participants who have a decrease in the levels of PSA\* by at least 50% in their blood (also known as PSA50). PSA is a protein made by the prostate gland. High levels of PSA may indicate the presence of prostate cancer.
* Participants' best response to treatment based on their PSA levels (also known as the best overall PSA response).

The study will have two parts. The first part, called dose escalation, is done to find the most appropriate dose of BAY3563254 for use in the second part of the study. For this, each participant will receive one of different increasing amounts of BAY3563254. They will take BAY3563254 as an injection into a vein. All participants in the second part of the study, called dose expansion, will receive the most appropriate dose of BAY3563254 that was identified from the first part of the study.

Participants in this study will take the study treatment once every 6 weeks, which is known as a treatment cycle. Each participant will have up to 4 of these treatment cycles, if the participant benefits from the treatment. Each participant will be in the study for approximately 6 years, including a screening phase of up to 30 days, 6 months of treatment depending on the participant's benefit, and a follow up phase of 60 months after the end of treatment.

In addition, substudies performed during both dose escalation and dose expansion parts of the study will evaluate:

* the clearance of radioactivity from the body over time
* the doses of radiation that are delivered to normal organs and tumors
* the ability of an experimental agent (Tris-POC) to decrease the amount of radiation absorbed by normal organs.

During the study, the doctors and their study team will:

* take blood and urine samples
* check vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature
* examine heart health using electrocardiogram (ECG)
* take tumor samples if required
* check if the participants' cancer has grown and/or spread using CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and bone scan
* check the tumor status using PET (positron emission tomography)
* check the amount of radiation absorbed by tumors and normal organs using SPECT/CT (single-photon emission tomography and computed tomography scan)
* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.

An adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatments. In addition, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire on quality of life at certain time points during the study.

The treatment period ends with a visit in 6-12 weeks after the last BAY3563254 dose. About 6-12 weeks after the last dose and every 6 weeks thereafter, the study doctors and their team will check the participants' health and any changes in their cancer. This active follow-up period ends after 18 months. The long-term follow-up period will start after the end of the active follow-up visit and will continue for up to 60 months after the the last BAY3563254 dose. Participants will be contacted, typically by phone call or clinic visit, approximately every 12 weeks after the end of active follow-up.","Advanced Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer|Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Expression","DRUG: 225Ac-PSMA-Trillium (BAY3563254)|DRUG: Tris-POC (BAY2688901)|DRUG: 111In-PSMA-Trillium (BAY3632687)","Bayer",,"ALL","ADULT, OLDER_ADULT","PHASE1",118,"INTERVENTIONAL","03/07/24 00:00:00",,,0,348,0,0,,,348,348,348,0,1,348,348,,0,,485,,,,485

Advanced NSCLC is a group of lung cancers that have spread to nearby tissues or to other parts of the body or that are unlikely to be cured or controlled with currently available treatments. HER2 is a protein that helps cells to grow and divide. A damage (also called mutation) to the building plans (genes) for this protein in cancer cells leads to a production of abnormal HER2 and therefore abnormal cell growth and division.

The study treatment, BAY 2927088, is expected to block the mutated HER2 protein which may stop the spread of NSCLC.

The main purpose of this study is to learn how well BAY 2927088 works and how safe it is compared with standard treatment, in participants who have advanced NSCLC with specific genetic changes called HER2 mutations.

The study participants will receive one of the study treatments:

* BAY 2927088 twice every day as a tablet by mouth, or
* Standard treatment in cycles of 21 days via infusion (""drip"") into the vein. The treatment will continue for as long as participants benefit from it without any severe side effects or until they or their doctor decide to stop the treatment.

During the study, the doctors and their study team will:

* take imaging scans, including CT, PET, MRI, and X-rays, of different parts of the body to study the spread of cancer
* check the overall health of the participants by performing tests such as blood and urine tests, and checking
* heart health using an electrocardiogram (ECG)
* perform pregnancy tests for women
* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.

This is a rare cancer that usually starts in the appendix and spreads around the abdomen.

PMP is usually treated using a type of surgery called Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS). During the surgery heated chemotherapy will also be used to treat any cancer cells that cannot be seen and may be left behind. This is called Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC).

This treatment is commonly used in the UK and in Europe, however, the chemotherapy can be given at two different doses: a lower dose over 60 minutes or a higher-dose over 90 minutes.

The Investigators want to understand if there is a difference between these two doses. The higher dose has been associated with a slightly increased rate of complications but may be better at killing cancer cells and preventing recurrence of cancer. In Basingstoke the lower dose over 60 minutes is used and survival results are similar to centres who use the higher dose.

Previous studies have shown that both doses are effective at treating PMP, but no research has shown which is better for patients. The Investigators hope to show that the lower-dose over 60-minutes is as good as the higher-dose over 90-minutes.","Pseudomyxoma Peritonei","Drug: Mitomycin c","University of Southampton",,"F","ADULT","PHASEIII",,"INTERVENTIONAL","09/01/24 00:00:00","09/01/28 00:00:00","04/01/29 00:00:00",0,508,1,0,,,508,508,508,0,1,507,507,"1",0,,507,,,,507
